    <h1>Bonuses</h1>
    <h2>AFS Bonus</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Safe driving bonus – £5 per day</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our vans are fitted with a system similar to a black box for recording driving. This helps reduce van costs and also supports us with any issues on the road. To be eligible for the safe driving bonus, you must achieve a daily driving score of 90% or higher.</p>

    <h2>Amazon Bonus</h2>
    <p>Amazon bonuses are based on the number of parcels you deliver and your driver scorecard. This includes metrics such as taking delivery photos, contacting customers, and overall delivery quality. These are simple to achieve if the job is done correctly, and the majority of our drivers earn the bonus every week.</p>

    <h1>About the Job</h1>
    <p>The day starts with receiving your route confirmation on the AFS app. Once confirmed and ready, you will complete a quick van check in the AFS app.</p>
    <p>When you arrive at the depot, you will need to give the yard marshal your route number (shown in the app). Then wait in the holding area until it is your time to load.</p>
    <p>Unlike other delivery jobs, loading at Amazon is a quick turnaround — usually around 15 minutes. Parcels are in bags and cages, making it efficient to load your van.</p>
    <p>The Amazon delivery app is very simple to use. It navigates you from stop to stop and prompts you with all relevant details, such as customer notes, parcel type, bag location, and access codes.</p>
    <p>Once finished, if you have any returns, you will either hand them to our Debrief Driver (who returns them to the depot) or return them yourself.</p>

    <h1>Next Steps</h1>
    <p>If you meet the requirements and are happy to join our team, we will begin the onboarding process. The next steps are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Once driving license verification is complete, you can start the background check</li>
      <li>Your background check usually takes 24 hours to complete</li>
      <li>After completion, you will be booked onto an online training session (a full day, paid)</li>
      <li>Following training, you will complete 2 ride-alongs (days on the road with experienced drivers)</li>
      <li>After these steps, you are ready to go on your own!</li>
    </ul>
