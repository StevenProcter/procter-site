  <h1>E-Mentor - Safe Driving</h1>
  <p><strong>E-Mentor</strong> is now a part of our scorecard and this is a third party app that records and measurues your driving throughout your route.</p>
  <h2>How to use E-Mentor</h2>
  <p>You must log in every single time you have a route at Amazon, failing to do so will impact adoption rate.</p>
  <p>For best results using the E-Mentor app, we advise using a second device. This to prevent any deductions for 'phone distractions' as using your phone when driving will massively impact your score. (even if answering the phone on hands free)</p>
  <p>Firstly, hotspot your spare device off your main phone, then log into e-mentor as usual with email and password. Then begin trip, give it about a minute and you can disconnect from the hotspot. Wedge your phone somewhere secure where it wont bang around, for example in the slit in the sunvisor or between the seats wedged.</p>
  <p>Make sure you log in either before you leave home or at your first stop. then you need to do atleast 3 hours driving time (more if in a low signal area) before you log out and upload your trip.If your trip fails to upload try again when home and connected to the wifi.</p>
<p>You need to be at a score of 810 or above for Fantastic, and if you get a score of below 780 you must tell your manager as they have the chance to reset you account so the poor score doesnt impact.</p>
