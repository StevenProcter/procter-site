  <h1>Did Not Receive (DNR DPMO)</h1>

  <p><strong>DNR</strong>, or “<strong>Did Not Receive</strong>,” also known as “<strong>Concessions</strong>,” is the metric representing the number of shipments that customers claim were never received, despite being marked as delivered by the driver.</p>

  <h2>Calculation</h2>
  <p>The calculation for the DNR DPMO metric is as follows:</p>
  <p><strong>Concession Amount ÷ Number of Packages You Delivered × 1,000,000</strong></p>

  <h2>Root Causes of Concessions</h2>
  <p>The root causes of concessions can be one of several factors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Doorstepping packages:</strong> Leaving packages on the customer’s doorstep or in an unsafe location without consent can result in theft or misplacement.</li>
    <li><strong>Delivering to neighbors without consent:</strong> This could result in theft or confusion.</li>
    <li><strong>Customer abuse:</strong> Some customers falsely claim non-receipt to get a refund or replacement.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Most Common Cause:</strong><br>
    The most frequent issue is <em>doorstepping without permission</em>. To prevent this, always try to call or text the customer and agree on a safe delivery solution.
  </div>

  <h2>Best Practices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If you leave the package in a customer’s selected safe location: <br>
      Leave a “We Missed You” card and contact the customer via call or text to confirm the drop-off.</li>
    <li>If you can't contact the customer and no safe place is provided: <br>
      Mark it as “Customer unavailable,” make a second contact attempt if prompted, and keep the parcel for reattempt or depot return.</li>
  </ul>
