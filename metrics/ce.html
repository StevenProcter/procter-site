<h1>Customer Escalations (CE)</h1>

<p><strong>Customer Escalations (CE)</strong> represent instances in which a customer contacts Amazon to report an issue related to a delivery experience. These are significant performance indicators and should be treated with the utmost seriousness.</p>

<h2>Escalation Timing</h2>
<p>Customer Escalation data is subject to a four-week delay. For example, an escalation submitted in Week 1 will be reflected on your scorecard in Week 4. This delay period provides Delivery Service Partners (DSPs) the opportunity to investigate and, if appropriate, appeal the escalation.</p>

<h2>Preventing Escalations</h2>
<p>The most effective way to prevent escalations is to consistently follow Amazon's delivery protocols and provide courteous, respectful service in every customer interaction. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Following all delivery procedures accurately and consistently</li>
  <li>Respecting customer property and preferences</li>
  <li>Maintaining a professional and calm demeanor at all times</li>
</ul>

  <div class="note">
  <strong>Important Safety Protocols</strong>
    <ul>
  <li>If a customer engages in aggressive or inappropriate behavior, report the situation to your DSP manager immediately.</li>
  <li>In any situation involving physical threats or violence, contact emergency services first, followed by your DSP manager.</li>
</ul>
    </div>

<h2>Protection Through Proper Procedure</h2>
<p>It’s important to understand that as long as you are consistently following the correct delivery procedures, Amazon will not uphold any customer escalation by default. If a customer complains but your actions were compliant with the process, the escalation will not impact your record.</p>

<p>By adhering to Amazon’s procedures and maintaining a high level of professionalism, you contribute to a positive customer experience and help reduce the likelihood of receiving a Customer Escalation.</p>
