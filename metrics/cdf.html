  <h1>Customer Delivery Feedback - CDF</h1>


  <p><strong>CDF</strong>, or “Customer Delivery Feedback,” is the percentage of customers who leave you a positive or negative review after a delivery is made.</p>

  <p>Once a delivery is made, customers receive an email notification with options to give a thumbs up or thumbs down regarding the delivery. Alternatively, customers can leave a review through the Amazon app. They will be asked several questions about the overall delivery experience, which determines your CDF.</p>

  <p>If you do not yet have a CDF score, Amazon will consider your CDF score based on your Customer Escalations.</p>

  <h2>Preventing a Poor CDF Score</h2>

  <p>To prevent a poor CDF score, it is important to always follow Amazon guidelines and best practices. Adhering to all other metrics typically results in an excellent DEX score, as you have done everything to provide the best delivery experience possible. Key practices include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Being kind and friendly</li>
    <li>Contacting the customer if they are not home</li>
    <li>Adhering to their specified safe location</li>
    <li>Leaving a “We missed you” card to inform the customer about the delivery status</li>
    <li>Avoiding actions that may upset the customer, such as doorstepping or walking across their lawn</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you find yourself chatting with a customer, it may not be a bad idea to simply ask them to leave you a positive feedback review!</p>

  <p>By following these guidelines, you can ensure a positive delivery experience and maintain a high CDF score.</p>
