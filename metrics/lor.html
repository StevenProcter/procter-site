  <h1>Lost on Road - LoR</h1>
  <p>Lost on Road is the newest metric to come to the scorecard</p>
  <p>This process is to reduce the number of parcels being lost whilst out in transit with the drivers</p>
  <h2>Best practises to prevent lost packages</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>When emptying bags out and orginising them in your van double check than non have fallen out in the process onto the ground or under the van</li>
    <li><strong>ALL</strong> parcels that cannot be delivered must be returned the either the remote debrief driver or the depot on the same day</li>
    <li>Parcels that have been delivered but cannot be completed on your device due to signal/map problems must been reported to your Manager</li>
    <li>Any packages marked as 'missing' during your day will be chased by your manager and if you do manage to find them whilst still on route are expected to be delivered before you finish (within reason)</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Important</strong>
    <ul>A reminder that all high value packages are under CCTV within the warehouse and when a driver marks one of these shipments as missing an investigation gets carried out to check if the driver had that package by the loss prevention team</ul>
    </div>
